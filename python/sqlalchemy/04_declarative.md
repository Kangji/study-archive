# DDL: ORM Mapped Class

When using the ORM, the process by which we declare `Table` metadata is usually combined with the process of declaring mapped classes.
The mapped class is any Python class weâ€™d like to create, which will then have attributes on it that will be linked to the columns in a database table.
While there are a few varieties of how this is achieved, the most common style is known as declarative,
and allows us to declare our user-defined classes and `Table` metadata at once.

```py
class Base(DeclarativeBase): ...
# Base with asyncio support
class Base(AsyncAttrs, DeclarativeBase): ...

metadata = Base.metadata
```

## ORM Mapped Class

With the Base class established, we can now define ORM mapped classes.
ORM mapped class will internally construct `Table` object associated with `Base.metadata`.

```py
class User(Base):
    __tablename__ = "users"
    __table_args = (CheckConstraint("true"),)

    id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = Column(String(30), nullable=False)
    dept_id: Mapped[int] = mapped_column(ForeignKey("dept.id", ondelete="CASCADE"), nullable=False)

    dept: Mapped[Department] = relationship(back_populates="users")

class Department(Base):
    __tablename__ = "dept"

    id: Mapped[int] = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
    name: Mapped[str] = Column(String(30), nullable=False)

    users: Mapped[list[User]] = relationship(back_populates="dept")
```

* Use `__table_args__` to provide additional arguments to table construct, such as table constraints.
* Use `mapped_column` just like using `Column` to define column. `mapped_column` is smarter.
    * It can infer SQL type with type annotation.
    * It can infer nullable with type annotation.
* `User.dept` and `Department.users` are relationships.
    * `back_populates` indicates the name of relationship attribute on the related class, which will be synchronized with this one.
    * Relationships are lazy.

### `AsyncAttrs`

Since relationships are lazy, it must not be used in async.
Instead, `Base` with `AsyncAttrs` supports `awaitable_attrs` field to access relationships asynchronously.

```py
dept: Department = await user.awaitable_attrs.dept
```
