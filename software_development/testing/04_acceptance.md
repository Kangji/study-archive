# Acceptance Test

- Final end-user testing in real-life scenario

## Types of Acceptance Test

- User Acceptance Test (UAT): Based on user story
- Alpha Testing: known testers
- Beta Testing: arbitrary testers

## Good UAT

- Easily understandable test case
- Test case clearly reflects the requirements
- Include only critical data
- Clearly described expected result

## UAT Lifecycle

- Planning
    - Requirements
    - Time & Effort Estimation
- Designing
    - User Story
    - Test Data & Environment: Scale down
    - Test Documentation
    - Positive / Negative Testing
- Execution
- Completion

## Time & Effort Estimation

- Simple formula: estimation based on simple mathematical assumption
- Three-point
- Experience

### Three-Point-Based Estimation

- Estimate three different scenarios
    - Optimistic / Most likely / Pessimistic
- Weighted Sum
    - Triangular: 1:1:1
    - PERT: 1:4:1

## Test Approach

- Two cycle
- Multi cycle
- Risk-based (RBT)

### Risk-Based Testing (RBT)

- When resource is limited
- High-priority first â‡’ medium priority
- If fails, run even if low priority
