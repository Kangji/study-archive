# Usability

- Quality of user’s experience
- Effectiveness, efficiency, overall satisfaction of user

## User Interface (UI)

- Everything that user encounters
- Good UI design: understand the **capabilities** and **limitations** of users

## Fitt’s Law

- Time required to move to a target
- log(distance / size)

## Hick’s Law

- Time to make decision
- log(# of choice)

## Cognitive Load Theory

- Perception: Vision has highest information bandwidth
- Memory: Better at recognition than recall
- Miller’s Magic Number: Only about 7 chunks of info held at once

## Mental Model

- Abstract, inner representations regarding things from external world

## Interface Gulf(불일치, 간극)

- Gulf within **evaluation**(of system state) and within **execution**(of action)

## How to Narrow Gulf

### Norman’s Design Principle

- **Affordance**: how things look - how they are used
- **Discovery / Visibility**: how clear can users know the options and how to access
- **Feedback**: response to user’s input
- **Constraint**: limit the range of interaction
- **Consistency**: similar operations/elements for similar task (i.e., undo & redo)
- **Mapping**: relationship between control & output

### Interface Metaphors

- Help designers deliver mental model
- Conflict with Simplicity, Consistency

### Follow Interface Convention

- UI Patterns

## UI Design Process

- Design
- **Prototype(storyboard, partial implementation, etc.)**
- Evaluation
- Requirement Establishment

## Usability Evaluation

- Cognitive Walkthrough
    - Designer plays user role
- Heuristic Evaluation
    - Analyze w/ heuristics
- User Test

### Usability Heuristics

- System status visibility
- Match between system ↔ real world
- User control & freedom
- Consistency
- Error prevention
- Recognition > Recall (minimize user’s memory)
- Flexibility & Efficiency
- Aesthetic & Minimal (no irrelevant)
- Help recognize, diagnose, recover error
- Help and documentation

### Limitations

- Important problems may get missed
- Too focused on minor issue
- Experts are biased
