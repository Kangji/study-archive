# SOLID Design Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

* A class should have **only one** reason to exist

## Open Closed Principle (OCP)

* Open to extension, closed to modification
* Can extend feature without modification
* Replace if-else with interface + polymorphism

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

* Subclass should extend the capabilities of superclass

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

* Must not implement unnecessary interface
* Interface should be segregated based on usage

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

* Entities must depend on abstraction
